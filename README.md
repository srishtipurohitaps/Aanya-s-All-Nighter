## Gameplay Overview

Help Aanya stay awake and finish her typing assignment before running out of energy!
Boost her productivity, manage her fatigue, and complete all levels for victory.

* Hold **Spacebar** to boost and type faster (if you have energy drinks left).
* Typing fills “Pages Typed” and increases fatigue.
* Use energy drinks wisely; running out disables boosting.
* If the fatigue bar fills up, Aanya dozes off and you lose.
* Complete the required number of pages to level up.
* Survive all levels to win.
