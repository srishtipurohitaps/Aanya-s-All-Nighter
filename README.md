# Aanya’s All-Nighter

A frantic typing sprint game for Godot! Help Aanya stay awake through three caffeine-fueled levels by balancing boosts, energy drinks, and stamina.

## Gameplay

- Cross the screen edge to refill drinks.
- Don't let the fatigue bar max out, or it's game over.
- Press **F** at any time for an instant restart.

## Features

- Three escalating levels (150/320/520 pages)
- Responsive controls and flashing boost indicator
- Instant retry and smooth resource management
